# Full-stack development with Scaffold DOT


## Introduction

Scaffold DOT is a similar tool to [scaffold-eth-2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2) that helps new Web3 Solidity developers get started with full-stack development. Scaffold DOT is specifically designed for PolkaVM, supporting local node execution and an explorer. Developers can easily check and deploy smart contracts, then use the UI to interact with them seamlessly.


## How to use 

### Step 1: Fork the scaffold-dot (https://github.com/scaffold-dot/scaffold-dot) 

![Fork the repository](images/fork.png)


### Step 2

```
git clone https://github.com/<your github name>/scaffold-dot
```


### Step 3 : Install dependences 

> **Note:** Make sure your node version > 22+
```
yarn install
```

### Step 4 : On a terminal, start the substrate node:

```
yarn chain
```

### Step 5 : On a second terminal, start the eth-rpc server:

```
yarn rpc
```


### Step 6: On a third terminal, deploy the test default contract:

```
yarn deploy 
```

### Step 7: On a fourth terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

### Step 8: Request native tokens using the faucet icon in the top right corner

### Step 9: Use READ/ WRITE Contract

## Requirements 

- [ ] **Add ERC20 example**
- [ ] **Add ERC721 examples**

### How to add a new contract on `Scaffold DOT`

- Create a new contract file in `packages/hardhat/contracts` directory (see [contracts folder](https://github.com/scaffold-dot/scaffold-dot/tree/main/packages/hardhat/contracts)), for example `ERC20.sol`

- Create an ignition module for the new contract. Ensure the module name matches the contract file name exactly[ignition modules](https://github.com/scaffold-dot/scaffold-dot/blob/main/packages/hardhat/ignition/modules/YourContract.ts) (e.g., if your contract file is `YourContract.sol`, the module should be named `YourContract`)

- Run `yarn deploy` again. Scaffold DOT will automatically detect the new contract and deploy it.
